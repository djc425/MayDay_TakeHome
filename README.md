# MayDay_TakeHome


Excited to share with you my take on fetching and displaying 20 random users from RandomUser.me. 

When you open the project you’ll see that a TableView of users is displayed. Then when a user’s row is selected a second ViewController is displayed displayed onto the navigation controller showing the larger version of the user’s picture, their name and their address.

I also pushed myself to include two different layouts depending on if this is viewed on an iPad or iPhone using the UITraitCollection methods.

This was a fun one to build and I’m looking forward to hearing yours and the teams thoughts.

Thank you again for the opportunity to share this take home exercise with you.
