# MayDay_TakeHome


Excited to share with you my take on fetching and displaying 20 random users from RandomUser.me. 

When you open the project you’ll see that a TableView of users is displayed. Then when a user’s row is selected a second ViewController is displayed displayed onto the navigation controller showing the larger version of the user’s picture, their name and their address.

I also pushed myself to include two different layouts depending on if this is viewed on an iPad or iPhone using the UITraitCollection methods. The iPad version has an extra feature on the detailViewController which allows you to "send" an email to the user based on their email address. Currently this is just a placeholder alert but the email label does have user interaction enabled.

This was a fun one to build and I’m looking forward to hearing yours and the teams thoughts.

Thank you again for the opportunity to share this take home exercise with you.
